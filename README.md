# Projet_R-emissions_CO2_vehicules

University project carried out during the 3rd year of my degree. The objective is to create and apply the first prediction models studied. The work is carried out on a vehicle database to predict CO2 emissions made available on the DataGouv.fr website.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of CO2 emissions from a vehicle database. The dataset is sourced from DataGouv.fr and serves as the basis for creating and applying predictive models.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- *[projet_traitement_data_init.R](projet_traitement_data_init.R) :* Contains the dataset used for analysis and modeling.
- *[proj_modifvar.R](proj_modifvar.R):* Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, and model development.
- *[Projet_ML_v2.R](Projet_ML_v2.R):* Source code files for functions or scripts used in the project.
- *modèles de regressions.R:* Saved machine learning models.

## About the Data :

Ensure you have the following datasets installed to run the project:
